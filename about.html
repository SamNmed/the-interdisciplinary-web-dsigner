            <h2 class="item-b">Why I personally love singing and my relationship with music.</h2>
            <p class="item-c">I have a fairly tightnit relationship with music. My father is a music professor at the University of Lethbridge and my mother is a piano teach and a choral composer. I grew up with music as a big part of my life. I play the cello and defenitly connect that with my singing. I really love that I'm finally taking voice lessons and developing as a singer. My course I'm referencing for this project is Secondary Voice Studio which I'm taking with Janet Youngdahl. I'm also in the uofl choir which is one of my favority courses and I would recomend it to anyone even if you don't sing. It is a really great community to be a part of and it is a lot of fun! </p>
